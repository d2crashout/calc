# The ML Calculator
### A simple cli calculator who's life goal is to be written in as many coding languages as possible.

I started this project because I wanted to learn just the basics of about any coding language I can think of

So far, it has worked!

I have learned about how Node.js does not have certain functions

I learned about the weird C function names

The super easy Ruby syntax

And so much more!!!
